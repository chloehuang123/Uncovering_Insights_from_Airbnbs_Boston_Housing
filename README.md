# Uncovering Insights From Airbnb's Boston Housing

This is a project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, where the goal is to explore AirBnB Boston housing data and answer three questions of interest:

1. Are prices predominantly influenced by a listing's location or by its amenities and features?

2. What is the correlation between a listing's comments/reviews and the scores it receives?

3. How effective are the provided data attributes in predicting a listing's price?

### Installations

The project uses Python 3.9.7 and several libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Sci-Kit Learn, and Matplotlib.

### Project Motivation

The main motivation for the project was to fulfill the requirements of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. To answer the questions of interest, the project uses data science and machine learning techniques.
