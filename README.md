# Uncovering Insights From Airbnb's Boston Housing

This is a project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, where the goal is to explore AirBnB Boston housing data and answer three questions of interest:

1. Are prices predominantly influenced by a listing's location or by its amenities and features?

2. What is the correlation between a listing's comments/reviews and the scores it receives?

3. How effective are the provided data attributes in predicting a listing's price?
